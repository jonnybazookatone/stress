# Stress Test Pipeline

## Overview

The purpose of this pipeline is to stress test, or benchmark web pages. It is a simple implementation of how to write custom timings rather than using built in dev-tools available on common webbrowsers.

The driving force behind most of the code is Selenium WebDriver, the defacto tool for automation of crawling webpages with a real browser instance.
